## Polaris - guiding the traffic home.

An extendable Global Server Load Balancing(GSLB) solution, DNS-based traffic manager.

* Built as an enhancement for [PowerDNS Authoritative Server](https://www.powerdns.com/auth.html)
* Load-balancing methods:
    * Weighted round-robin
    * Topology(direct clients to end-points in the same region/datacenter)
    * Failover group(active-backup)
* Parameterized(timeout, interval, retries etc.) health monitors:
    * TCP(send string, match regexp)
    * HTTP/S
* Up to 32 addresses returned in a response
* Different ways to handle the "all-pool-members-down" situation(fallback):
    * return any configured end-points(ignore the health status) 
    * refuse query
